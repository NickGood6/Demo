                    We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Anyone can paint. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. In your world you have total and absolute power.
